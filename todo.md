Explain the difference between a Host machine and a Target machine. Also explain development machine.

Students should buy their own SD card.

rpi-hello needs a script to inject it into an IMG file. We should allow students to add description to script so they can identify their own PI.


## Assignments:

Assignment
Install the git package and create a local clone inside your homedir (currently the user pi) of the repository https://github.com/BioBoost/multimediatechnieken

Assignment
Install the apache package and find out where the webpages are stored. Make sure you can view your PIâ€™s website from your host machine. Change the index.html page (you can use the nano editor for this) and add some cool things to it.

Is this feasible ? Maybe this might be too much.



## Difference && and ;

In the shell, && and ; are similar in that they both can be used to terminate commands. The difference is && is also a conditional operator. With ; the following command is always executed, but with && the later command is only executed if the first succeeds.

false; echo "yes"   # prints "yes"
true; echo "yes"    # prints "yes"
false && echo "yes" # does not echo
true && echo "yes"  # prints "yes"
Newlines are interchangeable with ; when terminating commands.
