## Challenges

### Setup SSH Keys

Setup your Raspberry Pi with SSH keys so you don't have to provide a password anymore.

Make sure to not generate new keys on your host machine if you already have some. Otherwise you will need to add them to services such as Github.

<!-- next year we need to check this for everyone ! Also make sure to ask back the uart bridges after that. -->
