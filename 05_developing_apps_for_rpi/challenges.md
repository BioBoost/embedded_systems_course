## Challenges

### Setup a share

Setup a shared folder on the Raspberry Pi using Samba to host your C++ projects.

### Create a hello world

Create a hello world application inside your shared iot projects on the Raspberry Pi. Also set it up as a git repo. Make sure it compiles on the RPi.

### Remote compilation

Using SSH you can also execute commands remotely. This means that you can actually compile your application on the Raspberry Pi without having to login.

Taking this even a step further, you can automate this as a task in Visual Code.
